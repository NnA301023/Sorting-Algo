# Sorting-Algo
## Run Experiment Result
Here's the google collabs link used to run code from this repository : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14re_hT6njN7TWJX7JG82Jkbqif_Y8GRC?usp=sharing
## Project Aim
Understand how each algorithm works in sorting random numbers with various number of arrays.
## What We Learn :
*  Various algorithm performance
*  Bubble Sort and Selection Sort are algorithms with the longest sorting process.
*  The condition of the device greatly affects the sorting speed
*  Overall, the algorithms that we implement, namely, Insertion, Merge, Heap, Binary Search Tree, and LLRB Tree, work at speeds below 1 second with an array size range from 10^1 to 10^6.
